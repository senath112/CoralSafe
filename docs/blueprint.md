# **App Name**: CoralSafe

## Core Features:

- Coral Suitability Prediction: Analyze uploaded sensor data using a pre-trained ML model to predict coral suitability. The model will use its tool to indicate if the data suggests a threatening environment.
- Data Upload: Allow users to upload sensor data in a standard format (e.g., CSV).
- Result Visualization: Display the analysis results with a clear visualization (e.g., a simple 'Suitable'/'Threatening' indicator and confidence level).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Sea blue (#2E8B57) to evoke a marine environment.
- Secondary color: Light beige (#F5F5DC) for a clean and neutral background.
- Accent: Coral (#FF7F50) to highlight key information and interactive elements.
- Clean and simple layout with a focus on data visualization.
- Use relevant icons related to marine life and data analysis.
- Subtle animations for loading states and data transitions.

## Original User Request:
a web based ML model to analyze sensor data from marine environments to check whether the place is suitable for plant corals or is that threatning to corals
