# 🌊 Mariana V2.0 — Intelligent Coral Reef Monitoring System

**Official Release Date:** May 1st, 2025

Mariana V2.0 is a next-generation marine monitoring system designed to predict and protect coral reef health. Powered by environmental datasets and a Machine Learning model built using the **Gemini API**, it evaluates coral supportiveness using real-time marine parameters.

> **“Protecting coral reefs through data, AI, and clean design.”**
This dataset contains **simulated marine environmental data** collected from **Reef_A** during April 2025, recorded at 6-hour intervals.

It is designed to work with a **Machine Learning model powered by the Gemini API** to predict whether marine environmental conditions are **supportive or threatening to coral health** based on multiple oceanographic parameters.

## 📈 Dataset Overview

### 🌊 Parameter Thresholds for Coral Health

| Parameter            | Ideal Range  | Caution / Warning     | Threatening / Dangerous        |
|----------------------|--------------|------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Water Temperature (°C) | 24–28       | 28–30                  | > 30                            |
| Salinity (PSU)         | 33–36       | 31–33 or 36–38         | < 31 or > 38                    |
| pH Level              | 8.0–8.3      | 7.8–8.0                | < 7.8 (Acidification)           |
| Dissolved Oxygen (mg/L)| > 6.0      | 4.0–6.0                | < 4.0 (Hypoxia)                 |
| Turbidity (NTU)       | < 1.0        | 1.0–3.0                | > 3.0 (Light Stress)            |
| Nitrate (mg/L)        | < 0.1        | 0.1–0.3                | > 0.3 (Suffocating)             |

Each value includes units for realism.

## 🤖 ML Model Goals (Gemini API)

- Predict coral supportiveness based on multiple features.
- Analyze up to **5 parameters** simultaneously:
  - Water Temperature
  - Salinity
  - pH Level
  - Dissolved Oxygen
  - Turbidity
  - *(Optional)* Nitrate
- Coral supportiveness is **not labeled** — the ML model must infer it.

## 📊 Parameter Ranges (Typical & Stressful)

| Parameter            | Supportive Range      | Stressful Range            |
|----------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Water Temperature     | 26°C – 29°C           | > 30°C or < 25°C           |
| Salinity              | 34.5 – 35.0 PSU       | < 34.0 or > 35.5 PSU       |
| pH Level              | 7.9 – 8.3             | < 7.6 or > 8.4             |
| Dissolved Oxygen      | > 5.5 mg/L            | < 5.0 mg/L                 |
| Turbidity             | < 3.0 NTU             | > 5.0 NTU                  |
| Nitrate               | < 0.10 mg/L           | > 0.25 mg/L                |

> Based on published coral reef research data.

## 🛠️ Notes

- No `Coral_Supportive` column is provided — **the model must predict it.**
- Data includes **natural variation** and **stress events**.
- Only one location (**Reef_A**) is included for April 2025.

---

## 📥 Future Upgrades

- [ ] Add more reef locations (Reef_B, Reef_C…)
- [ ] Add multi-depth sampling support
- [ ] Seasonal datasets (June, September, etc.)
